JavaHammer
----------

This is a simplified version of the popular Battle Masters board game by MB,
for two players.
Two armies must fight against each other moving their units across a battlefield.
There are three kind of units: infantry, bowmen and chivalry, each of them with
their special skills: attack range, move range,... players must choose wisely which
of them use for a better strategy in order to destroy the enemies, burn down their houses
to the ground and throw salt in their lands. 

That's the joy of total annhilation, that's the joy for JavaHammer: 
there is no prize for the second, only death and everlasting pain awaits 
in the evergrowing black fire of a eternal burning hell.

Raise your battleAxe, hold your hammer high, set your sword on fire; your brothers
in arms are waiting for your battle cry. Run javahammer and let the blood spill all
over the battlefield, until the ground can't drink anymore.
